# ReactReduxHoc

This is a project to understand better react, redux and now HOC (Higher Order Component)

I'm Following a tutorial from Stephen Grider if you are interesting to learning check his classes here
Udemy tutorial: [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

### Getting Started

Instead of using npm on this project I'm using yarn (You can use whatever you prefer)

To run the project you have to install first the dependencies
```
yarn install
```

Once you get all the dependencies installed, then for run the project you have to write this code
```
yarn start
```

This project is only focus on how you could use HOC. Authentication as it has to, is not present on this project.
